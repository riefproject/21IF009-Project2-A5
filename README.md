-   **assets/** ‚Üí Stores game assets:
    -   Sprites: Player, blocks, projectiles
    -   Sounds: Effects and background music
    -   Fonts: UI and display text
-   **db/** ‚Üí Stores game data (saved settings & scores):
    -   `settings.dat` - Stores user preferences (SFX, music, last played level)
    -   `hiscores.dat` - Stores high scores for all difficulty modes
-   **build/** ‚Üí Directory for compiled files (`build/output/`)
-   **bin/** ‚Üí Output directory for the final executable (`game.exe`)
-   **scripts/** ‚Üí Build automation scripts (`build.bat`, `clean.bat`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Requirements

-   GCC Compiler (MinGW/MSYS2 for Windows)
-   Raylib Graphics Library (Tested on Raylib 5.5+)
-   Make (optional, for Makefile support)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/riefproject/21IF009-Project2-A5.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 21IF009-Project2-A5
    ```

3. rebuild and run the project:

    - Using **Makefile** (recommended for Linux/macOS/Windows with MinGW):
        ```bash
        make rebuild
        ```
    - Or manually using script:
        - **Windows:**
            ```sh
            ./scripts/clean.bat rebuild
            ```
        - **Linux/macOS:**
            ```sh
            . scripts/build.sh
            # OR
            chmod +x scripts/build.sh  # Only needed the first time
            ./scripts/clean.sh rebuild
            ```

4. Additioal build options:
   Both build scripts support various commands for different build tasks. For all available commands and detailed documentation, see [`üìãscripts/README.md`](https://github.com/riefproject/21IF009-Project2-A5/blob/main/scripts/README.md). Common commands include: build (default), run, clean, rebuild, test, and help.
