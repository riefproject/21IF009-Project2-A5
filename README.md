## Features (More details)

**Block Shooter** is a fast-paced vertical shooter where quick reflexes and smart decisions keep you alive. Here's what makes it exciting:

### 🎯 Grid-Based Shooting

Shoot falling blocks to complete rows. Clear space, score points, and stay alive. Let the grid fill up — and it's game over.

### 🚀 Difficulty Modes

Play across multiple challenge levels: from **Super Easy** to **God Mode**, plus **Progressive Mode** that gets harder the longer you last.

### 🧠 Scoring

Clear rows, survive longer, and chase high scores. Each difficulty tracks its own leaderboard.

### ❤️ Lives

Start with three lives. Stay alive by avoiding harmful items and mistakes. Power-ups can help — or hurt.

### 🧪 Power-Ups

Power-ups drop randomly. Catch them to trigger effects:

| .   | Power-Up       | Effect                                   |
| --- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🟢  | Extra Life     | Adds one life (max 3)                    |
| 🟢  | Slow Down      | Blocks fall slower temporarily           |
| 🔴  | Poison         | Reduces one life                         |
| 🔴  | Speed Up       | Blocks fall faster temporarily           |
| 🟡  | Special Bullet | Clears a row, but leaves floating blocks |
| 🎲  | Lucky Box      | Random effect — sometimes hidden         |

Only three effects can be active. Use them wisely.

### 🔦 Laser

Need precision? Activate the laser pointer with **E** or **Right Shift**. Aiming made easier — for a limited time.

### 🧩 Challenge & Flow

Speed builds. Mistakes stack. Power-ups surprise. Block Shooter throws you into chaos — and dares you to master it.

## ⚙️ Build Requirements

-   GCC Compiler (MinGW/MSYS2 for Windows)
-   Raylib Graphics Library (Tested on Raylib 5.5+)
-   Make (optional, for Makefile support)

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/riefproject/21IF009-Project2-A5.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 21IF009-Project2-A5
    ```

3. rebuild and run the project:

    - Using **Makefile** (recommended for Linux/macOS/Windows with MinGW):
        ```bash
        make rebuild
        ```
    - Or manually using script:
        - **Windows:**
            ```sh
            ./scripts/clean.bat rebuild
            ```
        - **Linux/macOS:**
            ```sh
            . scripts/build.sh rebuild
            # OR
            chmod +x scripts/build.sh  # Only needed the first time
            ./scripts/clean.sh rebuild
            ```

4. Additioal build options:
   Both build scripts support various commands for different build tasks. For all available commands and detailed documentation, see [`📋scripts/README.md`](https://github.com/riefproject/21IF009-Project2-A5/blob/main/scripts). Common commands include: build (default), run, clean, rebuild, test, and help.

| Help       | H                                 |

### Objectives

-   Shoot strategically to clear block rows
-   Collect power-ups for advantages
-   Avoid letting blocks reach the bottom
-   Achieve high scores in each difficulty mode

### Tips

-   **Clear full rows to earn bonus points** – Rows will disappear when completely filled.
-   **Use power-ups wisely** – Some power-ups can turn the tide of battle.
-   **Master the laser ability** – It has a cooldown, so use it at the right moment.
-   **Watch falling block patterns** – Predict the next move and adjust your shots.
-   **Optimize shot timing** – Spamming bullets might not always be the best strategy.
